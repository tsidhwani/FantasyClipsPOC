help me flush out an app idea. the premis is around helping fantasy football team managers see their player's highlights without having to go searching on the internet for the plays that got them points, and without having to watch games/highlights to see what happened. 

i know myself and many other fantasy football managers want to see our players score touchdowns, or make 20 yard catches, but don't watch the games on sunday or care quite enough to parse long videos of highlights or games to find the exact moments some major points were scored. Help me flush out how i could bring this app idea to life. I really just need this to be a POC, but go over everything regarding how i would make this, including frontend / backend design, what API to ai calls I would need, how I could find the relevant videos and coalate them to one central place for people to watch, etc

Thought for 34s

Love this idea—“show me only the moments that won me points.” Here’s a concrete, end-to-end plan to get a scrappy but impressive POC live.

1) What the POC does (scope)

Connect a user’s fantasy league → detect their roster for the current week.

Pull play-by-play for those players’ games.

Auto-compile a short, per-player reel of only point-scoring + splash plays (TDs, 20+ yd catches/runs, big defensive plays, etc.).

Present as a clean feed: “Player → plays → tap to watch embedded clip at the exact moment.”

2) Data sources & licensing (realistic options)

Fantasy/roster:

Sleeper API (free, no auth, read-only) for leagues/rosters—great for a POC. 
Sleeper API

Yahoo Fantasy Sports API (official, OAuth) if your league is on Yahoo. 
Yahoo Developer Network

ESPN: no official public fantasy API; community-documented endpoints exist but are unofficial—OK for a hacky POC, risky for production.

Play-by-play (PBP):

Sportradar NFL API (paid, realtime, enterprise-grade). If you want near-live alerts/highlights on Sundays, this is the pragmatic route. 
Getting Started

nflverse / nflfastR & nfl_data_py (free, historical & nightly updates). Perfect for a Monday-morning recap POC. 
GitHub

Video clips (must be licensed or embedded from authorized sources):

YouTube: search official NFL/Team channels, embed videos, deep-link with start times; follow YouTube API ToS. Don’t download/rehost. 
Google for Developers
+2
Google for Developers
+2

X (Twitter): embed tweets w/ video via oEmbed (great for team official accounts). Again, embed—don’t rehost. 
X Developer

NFL Films/NFL licensing: direct video licensing exists but is a business process and not needed for a POC; do not redistribute NFL footage without rights. 
pads.nfl.net
+1

TL;DR legality for POC: only embed (YouTube/X) and strictly follow their ToS; do not download/modify/redistribute NFL footage. For production or your own hosted clips, expect formal licensing. 
Google for Developers

3) Architecture (POC)

Frontend (mobile first): React Native + Expo (fast iteration).
Backend: Python (FastAPI) or Node (NestJS/Express).
DB: Postgres (core data) + Redis (queues/cache).
Worker: Celery/BullMQ for scraping/searching/matching.
Storage: You don’t store videos; you store embed metadata (provider, URL, start/end times).

Key services & flow

Auth + league connect

User logs in → choose “Connect Sleeper/Yahoo/ESPN”.

Fetch and cache league → team → roster for current week. (Sleeper has a simple REST flow; Yahoo requires OAuth.) 
Sleeper API
+1

Games + plays

Option A (live Sundays): ingest play-by-play from Sportradar webhooks/feeds and tag plays involving rostered players. 
Getting Started

Option B (POC recap): after games end, pull weekly PBP from nflfastR / nfl_data_py and filter for your rostered players + event types. 
GitHub

Clip finding

Build a “search recipe” per play:
"{Player} touchdown Week {X} {Away} at {Home}"
→ Search YouTube Data API limited to official channels (NFL, team channels) to reduce junk. Parse durations; pick the primary game highlight video. 
Google for Developers

Optional: also search X for the official team tweet with the clip; store the oEmbed HTML. 
X Developer

Timestamp alignment (POC-friendly)

Quick heuristic:

Use PBP quarter + game clock to estimate absolute video timestamp by aligning with first scoring drive or kickoff (derive an offset by matching the first known TD text in the video’s description/chapters; many official highlights have chapter markers).

If chapters exist (YouTube provides chapter timestamps via the player if the video has them), snap to the nearest “{Team} TD” chapter.

Fallback: fuzzy match the video’s autogenerated captions (ASR) for player name + “touchdown”/“yards” and pick the timestamp peak.

Store start_sec (and optional end_sec) per play.

Reel assembly

Group by player → week; sort chronologically; render a playlist UI with embedded players, each preloaded to start_sec.

Notifications (optional POC)

After your worker finishes matching, push a single “Your Week X Highlights are ready” message.

4) Data model (minimal)

users: id, email, provider(s) linked

leagues: id, provider, season, scoring rules (optional)

rosters: user_id, week, list[player_id]

plays: game_id, play_id, time (quarter, clock), team, player_ids[], event_type, yards, fantasy_points_est

clips: play_id → {provider: 'youtube'|'x', url, start_sec, end_sec?, confidence}

5) How you detect “highlight-worthy”

Filters over PBP:

Touchdowns: pass_touchdown, rush_touchdown, return_touchdown.

Explosive plays: yards_gained >= 20 (receiving/rushing), long field goals, sacks/INTs for IDP.

Fantasy relevance: map league scoring to rank events (e.g., 6pt TD > 2pt conversion > 20+ yd chunk).
These fields are available via paid feeds (Sportradar) or via nflverse datasets (post-game).

6) Frontend UX (POC screens)

Connect League → provider buttons → success state with your starters for Week X.

This Week’s Highlights

Cards per player (headshot, matchup).

Below each card: a list of plays → each opens an embedded YouTube video starting at the exact second; “Next play” jumps to the next timestamp.

Toggle “Only TDs / All big plays”.

Auto-reel: “Play all” stitches timestamps (programmatically seek the YouTube player in sequence).

7) Implementation details (APIs & example calls)

Sleeper (POC friendly):

Get user → leagues → rosters → players with a few REST calls (no token). Rate-limit respectfully. 
Sleeper API

Yahoo:

Use OAuth 2.0, then call /team/roster, /league/players, etc. Good OSS wrappers exist (e.g., yfpy). 
Yahoo Developer Network
+1

ESPN (if needed):

Use community docs carefully; endpoints can change. 
GitHub

PBP (post-game POC):

nfl_data_py (Python) → import_weekly_pbp(season, week) → filter by your players’ IDs; store interesting plays. 
GitHub

YouTube search + embed:

search.list(q="Patrick Mahomes touchdown Week 6 Chiefs at Bills", channelId=<official channel optional>, type=video, eventType=none, maxResults=5)

Use videos.list to get durations; store videoId. Embed with https://www.youtube.com/embed/{id}?start={sec} under YouTube API ToS. 
Google for Developers
+1

X embed (backup/source of single-play clips):

Given a tweet URL, fetch oEmbed HTML via https://publish.twitter.com/oembed?url=<tweetUrl> and render. 
X Developer

8) “Timestamping” strategy (lightweight → smarter)

v0 (fastest): rely on chapter markers in official “full-game highlights” and simple offsets (kickoff ≈ 0).
v1: fetch captions via YouTube player APIs; TF-IDF/fuzzy match for player last name + “touchdown/yard gain/interception” → take the highest scoring timestamp within ±90s of the play’s estimated time.
v2: ASR locally (OpenAI Whisper) on downloaded audio only if permitted by the video’s license; for POC, avoid downloading—stick to player APIs and captions. (Downloading likely violates ToS.) 
Google for Developers

9) Backend matching algorithm (POC pseudocode)
for player in roster:
  plays = get_pbp_for_week(player)
  for play in plays:
    if is_highlight_worthy(play):
       queries = build_queries(player, play)
       candidates = youtube_search(queries) + x_search(queries)
       best = rank_candidates(candidates, play)   # channel priors, duration, views, recency
       t = estimate_timestamp(best, play)         # chapters/captions/offset heuristic
       save_clip(play_id, best.url, t)

10) Infra & devops (lean)

Hosting: Render/Fly.io/Heroku for API + worker; Supabase/Railway for Postgres.

Jobs: Sunday night / Monday morning cron to generate reels; on-demand button to re-generate.

Monitoring: Sentry + simple logging of “play → clip confidence”.

Feature flags: “TD-only” vs “All big plays”.

11) Risks & how to handle them

Rights & ToS: Never store/serve NFL footage. Only embed from authorized sources; follow YouTube/X terms. For commercial production or your own hosted clips, factor in NFL footage licensing timelines/costs.

12) Build plan (2–3 short sprints)

Sprint 1 (backend + data):

Connect Sleeper → fetch roster for Week X. 
Sleeper API

Pull PBP for Week X with nfl_data_py; filter highlight plays for rostered players. 
GitHub

Sprint 2 (clip search + timestamping):

YouTube search + simple ranking (prefer NFL/Team channels). 
Google for Developers

Implement chapter/caption timestamp heuristic; save start times.

Sprint 3 (frontend polish):

React Native screens: Connect → Highlights → Reel.

Embed YouTube player with start query; add “Play next highlight” UX.

Optional X embed fallback for single-play clips. 
X Developer

13) “Nice to have” for the demo

Per-play overlay: show your league’s scoring for that exact play (e.g., “+6 TD, +4 reception+yards”).

Share: auto-generate a share link to the exact timestamp.

Multi-league: toggle which league’s roster drives the feed.

Quality score: show a tiny “match confidence” icon, and a “Report mismatch” button to collect fixes.

If you want, I can spin up a tiny schema, sample sleeper + nflverse code, and a React Native screen stub you can run—just tell me which provider your league’s on (Sleeper/Yahoo/ESPN).
